# Wholesale, Retail & Finance Management System (Excel)

## Business Context
This system was developed for a product-based business managing both retail and wholesale operations. The client needed a unified platform to track inventory, expenses, wholesale clients, retail sales, payments, and outstanding credit — all while maintaining a clear financial overview.

## Problems
- Retail and wholesale sales were tracked separately with no central control  
- Expenses were not connected to business performance  
- Credit and due payments were difficult to monitor  
- No real-time financial or inventory visibility  
- Manual processes caused errors and delays  

## Solution
I designed a full Excel-based business operations system that integrates retail sales, wholesale invoicing, expense management, inventory tracking, client accounts, and finance analytics into one connected platform with a navigation menu and automated dashboards.

## Key Features
- Retail and wholesale sales management modules  
- Wholesale client database with dynamic price lists  
- Automated expense tracking and categorization  
- Live inventory and restocking status  
- Credit tracking with due dates and default alerts  
- Financial performance analytics dashboard  
- Central navigation menu for system-level usability  

## Tools & Methods
Microsoft Excel, advanced formulas, structured system design, business analytics modeling, financial tracking logic.

## Outcome
The client received a single, unified system to manage daily operations, monitor financial health, track outstanding payments, and control inventory. This replaced multiple disconnected sheets and enabled clearer, faster business decisions.
