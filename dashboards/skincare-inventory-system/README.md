# Automated Inventory, Sales & Profit Dashboard
# Automated Inventory, Sales & Profit Management System

## Business Context
This project was developed for a small retail/skincare business that was managing products, purchases, and sales across scattered spreadsheets with no clear visibility into true profit or inventory status.

## Problem
- No reliable inventory tracking  
- No real profit visibility  
- Manual, error-prone updates  
- No performance overview  

## Solution
I designed a fully connected Excel-based system that integrates product data, purchasing, sales, inventory, and profit tracking into one automated management dashboard.

## Key Features
- Live inventory tracking with restock status  
- Automated product costing (including tax and logistics)  
- Central purchase and sales databases  
- Monthly revenue and profit analytics  
- Interactive management dashboard  

## Tools & Methods
Microsoft Excel, advanced formulas, structured data modeling, business analytics design.

## Outcome
The system gave the client a single source of truth to monitor stock, profitability, and business performance, enabling faster restocking decisions and clearer financial insight.
